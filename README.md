# PCC-CS393

### This repository contains Python programs which I practised and notes I referred to in my third semester for the PCC-CS393 paper(IT WORKSHOP) as a part of the 2nd year B.Tech Curriculum
<br>

## How to Install

1. Create a ```Python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/komal-agarwal5/PCC-CS393.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd <folder_name> ```. 
4. Go to the [Python website.](https://www.python.org/)
5. Download the software.
6. Install it according to the guide.
7. Open terminal and type ```python --version``` to see whether it is properly installed or not.
8. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts. 

## Usage
-  To run any python program, run ``` python filename.py```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
- If the above command doesn't work, then run ``` python3 filename.py```, where again filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.

## FAQ
- How to stop the script? Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac) 
- For any other problems, feel free to raise an issue.
