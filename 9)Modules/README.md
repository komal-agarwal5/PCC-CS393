Generate a random value between two integers, inclusive:

0

1

Generate a random multiple of 7 between 0 and 70:

70

b. Write a Python program to generate a random integer between 0 and 6 - excluding 6, random integer between 5 and 10 - excluding 10,random integer between 0 and 10, with a step of 3 and random date between two dates.

Generate a random integer between 0 and 6:

0

Generate random integer between 5 and 10, excluding 10:

5

Generate random integer between 0 and 10, with a step of 3:

3


Random date between two dates:

2019-02-17

c. Write a Python program to convert degree to radian.Note: The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (when the arc length is equal to the radius)

Test Data:

Degree: 15

Expected Result in radians: 0.2619047619047619

d. Write a Python program to calculate surface volume and area of a cylinder.
Note: A cylinder is one of the most basic curvilinear geometric shapes,the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given straight line, the axis of the cylinder.

Test Data:

volume: Height (4), Radius (6)

Expected Output:

Volume is: 452.57142857142856

Surface Area is: 377.1428571428571
