a. Write a Python program to create a dictionary and do the following:
i. Sort Dictionary by key.
ii. Sort Dictionary by value.

b. Write a Python Program to create grade calculator, creating a dictionary which consists of the student name, assignment result test results and their respective lab results.
Given different scored marks of students. We need to find grades. The test score is an average of the respective marks scored in assignments,tests and lab-works. The final test score is assigned using below formula.

10 % of marks scored from submission of Assignments
70 % of marks scored from Test
20 % of marks scored in Lab-Works

Grade will be calculated according to :

score >= 90 : "A"
score >= 80 : "B"
score >= 70 : "C"
score >= 60 : "D"

Example input:

james = { "name":"James Potter",
"assignment" : [82, 56, 44, 30],
"test" : [80, 80],
"lab" : [67.90, 78.72]
}

Example output:

Average marks of James Potter is : 75.962
Letter Grade of James Potter is : C

c. Write a program to create two Dictionaries. Take a key from the 1st dictionary and find it in the 2nd dictionary. Display the corresponding value if found otherwise print appropriate message.Also merge the two dictionaries and display the output.

d. Write a python program to Replace words from Dictionary.
e.g. Input : test_str = ‘TechnoIndia is one of the best colleges in India
’, repl_dict = {“India” : “West Bengal”}

Output : TechnoIndia is one of the best colleges in West Bengal

Explanation : “India” word is replaced by lookup value.
