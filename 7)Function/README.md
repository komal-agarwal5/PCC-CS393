a. Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.

b. Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.

Sample List: [8, 2, 3, -1, 7]

Expected Output: -336

c. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower caseletters.

Sample Input: 'The quick Brown Fox'

Expected Output:

No. of Upper case characters: 3

No. of Lower case Characters: 12

d. Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
Note: Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.

Sample Pascal's triangle:

    			1
	
    	      1   1
	
    	    1   2   1
	
    	  1   3   3   1
	
    	1   4   6   4   1

Each number is the two numbers above it added together.

e. Write a Python program, where N number of integer arguments are passed to a function make_sum(), which will print the sum of all the passed integers.
